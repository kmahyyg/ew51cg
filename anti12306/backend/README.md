# Anti12306

This project is the backend part of my computer vision project in web.

The backend is running via `Tensorflow` and `Keras` cooperating with MariaDB.

# The frontend

Running via `caddy` server and served inside the YNU network for experimental purposes.

The server is written in Python with `Flask` as a pure API server for communicating with the `Tensowflow` backend and get the OCR result.

The UI part is built with `mdbootstrap` and then use AJAX via `JQuery` to communicate.

## Web Backend

All API related may be generated by Swagger. Really EASY and Ready for use.

Check [Database schema](/apidocs/dbschema.md) for database designing.

Check [API Reference](/apidocs/reference.html) for API reference.

## Web Frontend

Write in `mdbootstrap` and `jQuery`, the working procedure:

Login -> Recharge -> Check balance and permission -> Upload photo -> Get result and UUID in JSON

Login -> Report error or not satisfied with UUID

Including: 

- [X] | History with Error Report
- [X] | Login
- [X] | Recharge
- [X] | User Center(Show API key and user status, is_vip, balance)
- [X] | Upload'n'Check

## Tensorflow Backend

Check [Github: kmahyyg/anti12306](https://github.com/kmahyyg/anti12306). Still under construction. The `backcomm.py` in web backend is used for communicating purpose.
